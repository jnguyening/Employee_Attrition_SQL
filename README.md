# Employee Attrition Analysis using SQL

## Overview

Understanding the factors that drive employee satisfaction is essential for reducing attrition and maintaining organizational health. This project addresses this by performing a deep-dive analysis of HR data in MySQL, specifically investigating how departmental culture and workload impact morale. By utilizing conditional logic (CASE statements), I benchmarked the top and bottom departments against a variety of performance indicators, including average project volume, monthly work hours, and five-year promotion rates. The findings provide a clear, data-backed view of the relationship between compensation and employee happiness, offering actionable insights for HR leaders looking to optimize workforce management and improve retention.
